# hangman-cli-game
Basically, this is a short little hangman game I wrote in Java when I was bored. Lightweight, runs on Command Line, and modifiable! Includes features such as displaying
which letters are guessed, a text version of the hangman error counter, and a replay feature. Go into the source code to modify the word bank.

To Run this game on your machine:

1. Clone this Repo
2. Go into the file location of this project
3. Open your preferred CLI
4. Enter "javac HangmanMain.java" (this will compile the project)
5. Enter "java HangmanMain"
6. Enjoy!

Likely requires a version of Java on your machine, probably Java 8 or above should work fine
